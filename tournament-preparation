Tournament preparation process on DDNet
=======================================

3-6 days prior:
- Make a nice screenshot and prepare the msgpack file
- Put the screenshot on ddnet.tw too
- Announce on DDNet Forum, TW Forum, TW-Friends
- Announce on DDNet.tw
- Announce in Client: news and kill versionsrv (auto-restarts)
- Announce on Server: motd/news
  Also scripts/print.sh, first days only lower lines, comment out upper ones
  ./git-update-files-only.sh
  Crontab all servers to run print.sh every 2 hours

24 hours before:
- Change scripts/print.sh to run the upper part and write some nice messages
  ./git-update-files-only.sh
  Crontab all servers to run print.sh every minute (yes, will only print every hour at the start, then faster)

- Prepare the right Tournament scripts:
  scripts/quick-tournament.py for regular team quick tournaments (first wins)
  scripts/solo-quick-tournament.py for the same on solo maps
  scripts/solo-tournament.py for best time wins on solo maps

  Edit the tournament file

  Example run: scripts/solo-tournament.py Solo > /var/www/tournaments/38/index.html

During the night before:
- Edit motd/tournament.cfg based on info about the map and the current news from maps/*.map.cfg
- Edit tournament-prepare.sh on each server (except ddnet.tw) to run a nice map before the tournament, also make sure the other server settings are right
- When the server is empty, run ./tournament-prepare.sh
- When a server is full later, edit tournament-prepare.sh to add another server
- Prepare tournament-start.sh on ddnet.tw, update it to all servers
  Use a fun loading screen
- Make sure all times are correct on servers, only do an ntp sync when servers are empty as it times everyone out
- Make sure the MySQL synchronization isn't broken anywhere
  show slave status; as mysql root

1 hour before:
- cssh ddnet and abc
- Occasionally write something interesting or useful, for example at 40 min and 20 min explain the tournament
- Edit tournament-start.sh on locations with multiple servers to include them
- Connect to all/many interesting servers to watch

- Set livestream on website when it goes online

2 minutes before:
- Stop crontab scripts, write manually with abc
- When Tournament starts, switch to ./bc.py > servers/83{03,04,05}.fifo (all tournament servers)
- Upload the Tournament map (don't add it to votes) and ./git-update-files-only.sh
  Make sure the Tournament map is on all servers

Tournament starts:
- ./tournament-start.sh
- Make sure the Tournament map loads everywhere
- Broadcast interesting events of the tournament
- Periodically run scripts/xx-tournament.py > /var/www/tournaments/xx/index.html

Tournament finished:
- Announce the winners
- Add the map to types/*/maps and ./git-update.sh (This also turns the Tournament servers into regular servers again)
